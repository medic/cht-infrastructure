# HOSTING THE CHT APP
The Self Hosting guide has moved [to the docs site](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/hosting/self-hosting/) and the `docker-compose.yml` is using the existing copy in the [`cht-core` repo](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/master/docker-compose.yml). The [`prepare-system` directory](./prepare-system) in this repo is still active.
